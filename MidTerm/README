Overview:
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying Portable Executable (PE) files as benign or malicious using the MalConv architecture with the Ember dataset. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the model, and attempting deployment on AWS SageMaker.

Contents:
Code: Contains all the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Data: Includes the Ember dataset and any additional datasets used in the project.
Models: Stores the trained model checkpoints and any saved model artifacts.
Documentation: Contains documentation files, including this README.md.
Usage:
Data Preprocessing: Use the provided scripts or notebooks to preprocess the dataset, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.
Model Training: Train the MalConv model using the preprocessed data. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training configurations.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
Deployment: Attempt to deploy the trained model on AWS SageMaker. Ensure that the necessary credentials and resources are available for deployment.
